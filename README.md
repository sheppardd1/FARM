# FARM
The Field Augmented Routing Module allows users to track their location history while moving around a field. Application is still in development.
## Current functionality
Plots users location with a marker on a map at a user-defined refresh rate. Stores data about accuracy in .txt file. Based on https://github.com/sheppardd1/Mapping_GPS
## TODO
* Plot user's location using a ployline instead of individual point markers
* Adjust width of polyline based on user-defined tractor width
* Give user ability to define field area on map by adding points to create a polygon
